This full-stack web application is designed to allow the basic CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete - operations on a database of campuses and students. 

The [backend](https://github.com/marcintomala/Campuses-Students-Backend) consists of a PostgreSQL database served by a Node/Express server utilizing Sequelize for object-relational mapping.

This frontend is a React Single Page App which allows the user to manipulate the campuses and students tables, but adding, editing, deleting campuses and students, as well as assigning students to campuses. The user can input a name, image url, address, and a description for each campus and a first name, last name, image url, email address, and GPA for each student.
